# SoundScope

SoundScope is a web application for analyzing music tracks to get a better overview of a song and its mix.

The goal of the project is to help producers and artists understand their tracks better by analyzing audio data and comparing it to a reference track. This makes it easier to identify differences in balance, tone, and overall mix decisions.
